# Big Data Project: Sales Data Analysis and Price Prediction Using Apache Spark

This project leverages the power of **Apache Spark** to analyze a large-scale sales dataset and build a robust price prediction model. The project highlights the application of **big data technologies** in handling, analyzing, and deriving actionable insights from massive datasets.

## Project Highlights:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understand the structure and trends within the sales dataset.
   - Perform EDA on key metrics like sales trends, revenue distribution, and customer behavior using Spark SQL and DataFrames.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values, clean and preprocess the dataset.
   - Engineer features such as regional sales performance, seasonal trends, and product demand metrics.

3. **Big Data Analytics**:
   - Use Apache Sparkâ€™s capabilities to process and analyze large-scale data efficiently.
   - Perform group-by operations, aggregations, and joins to extract meaningful patterns.

4. **Machine Learning with Spark MLlib**:
   - Build a price prediction model using Sparkâ€™s MLlib.
   - Train and evaluate regression models such as Linear Regression and Gradient Boosted Trees.
   - Optimize model performance using Spark's pipeline and parameter tuning.

5. **Insights and Visualization**:
   - Generate actionable insights to guide pricing strategies and sales optimizations.
   - Visualize key findings using external tools integrated with Spark, like Jupyter Notebooks or Tableau.

## Key Benefits of Using Apache Spark:

- **Scalability**: Efficiently process and analyze datasets of any size.
- **Speed**: Perform data processing and machine learning tasks faster with in-memory computations.
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with big data tools like Hadoop, HDFS, and cloud storage.
